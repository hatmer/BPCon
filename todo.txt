### TODO ###

maxballot increases even for failed 1a send
verify 2b successfully sent before updating mBal and mVal
custom error handling in send_msg
verify runtime environment
2b verify val
timestamps for group ops
logging -> make consistent
configManager check os
corrupt state -> cannot verify so requests bmsgs next round if still in same epoch
dynamic config: bmsg requests, add_peer requests just get this (epochs(state image hashes)) - startup script requests current image from web portal
load balancer: makes cloned state available, dns, registers wss and latency of joining peer, outward-facing api access
 -> calculates system maximum capacity, counts api requests, randomizes which node gets to handle request or uses cache
remove peer list stuff from config
algorithms
single-port fxn
clean up 
web api / demo
split op: db sort and partition / optimize
fix orderedDict
